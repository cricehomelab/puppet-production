I purchased the domain "ricehomelab.net". Since I just acquired it i am in the process of having all of my lab infrastructure use this domain. 

I've edited my host templates at /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.debian.tmpl to reflect the correct hostname and FQDN.  
My firstline is similar to

192.16.50.### nameofservice.ricehomelab.net {{hostname}}

I also removed my static host configurations to get the servers to check in with the puppet master.

Using Pihole I updated my DNS records there to have the correct domains for the new domain name. This should prevent me from having to update the hosts file on each device i want
to be able to contact each other on the domain. I also think I can make a module in puppet to keep that updated. 

The other thing I needed to do since this whole process broke puppet was to update my DNS servers with Netplan to use my Pihole server rather than my router as the DNS. 

Once that was done the puppet.conf file needed updated for my puppetmaster and pihole.
