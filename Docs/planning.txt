Current Plan.

Phase 1: 
1. Puppet will install/build any system we can. 
    - Reasoning: To learn how to use puppet better. This is used a lot at work and I'd like to be able to use it better. 
2. PiHole install.
    - Reasoning:  Pihole has a widely used community I know I am not the first person to want to automate the installation of it. 
    - Challenges: Figuring out how the unattended install worked was my first hurdle. 
                  The second major hurdle was to figure out the right procedure to do in puppet. For instance the order of operations.
                  The other barrier I had was that I am commiting my code to a github repo and the unattended install had a hashed password in it. While the password was hashed,
                  I did not want to risk exposure to this. So as a solution to this I went ahead and set the hashed value as an environment variable on my pihole server,  put 
                  the hashed password there, and finally used a puppet template to insert the password in the correct place so that the password, hashed or not would not be 
                  commited to code. 
    - Future:     I am looking into if there are any post install changes I might like to make, and if possible I would like to make them with puppet rather than the pihole 
                  dashboard. 

Phase 2:
