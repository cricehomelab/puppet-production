Current Plan.

Phase 1: 
1. Puppet will install/build any system we can. 
    - Reasoning:  To learn how to use puppet better. This is used a lot at work and I'd like to be able to use it better. 
    - Challenges: The biggest challenge so far was migrating domains, on the bright side i should not need to do that again. 
                  The thing about the migration that was nice is that once the VM was re-configured there was little to no code tinkering to get the 
                  rest of the infrastructure to work. 
    - Results:    Installed Pihole unattended
                  Managing IP configuration to set DNS
                  Managing hosts file to ensure the hosts are correct. 
2. PiHole install.
    - Reasoning:  Pihole has a widely used community I know I am not the first person to want to automate the installation of it. 
    - Challenges: Figuring out how the unattended install worked was my first hurdle. 
                  The second major hurdle was to figure out the right procedure to do in puppet. For instance the order of operations.
                  The other barrier I had was that I am commiting my code to a github repo and the unattended install had a hashed password in it. While the password was hashed,
                  I did not want to risk exposure to this. So as a solution to this I went ahead and set the hashed value as an environment variable on my pihole server,  put 
                  the hashed password there, and finally used a puppet template to insert the password in the correct place so that the password, hashed or not would not be 
                  commited to code. 
    - Future:     I am looking into if there are any post install changes I might like to make, and if possible I would like to make them with puppet rather than the pihole 
                  dashboard. 
    - Results:    Pihole is up and running as the DNS of my lab. 
                  It is not the DNS of the home network yet I want to run with it as my daily DNS for a few weeks on my computer to work out any kinks and to give it a "pilot".
                  Pihole can be used to handle my hosts maintenance so my VMS can communicate as they need to. I have to do a little bit extra to get puppet to pick up initially
                  but after that its very helpful. 
3. add a proper domain. 
    - Reasoning: I would sort of like to do this before this becomes inconveniant to do. 2 machines is better than more, with Pihole set up as DNS now I can enforce my other devices
    to use Pihole as DNS and configure the hosts for the pihole. 
    - Challenges: Adding a proper domain was not bad, but it was time consuming as I ended up having to rebuiild my puppet and pihole servers. It was significantly less time 
                  consuming with having most of the config written as code. This also allowed for me to write a module around the networking needs in the lab. The nice thing 
                  is that now that this is set it will be unlikely that I will need to do this again. 
*********** Start REMOVED THIS FROM LAB ****************
4. Plex server
    - Reasoning: This is another self-hosting service that has a lot of documentation for it. So getting this set up should be doable.
    - Planning: 
        - Needs: 
            - VM - CREATED
            - deployment plan - IN PROGRESS 
                - going to install this from puppet. 
                - need to write module up and get it running on the VM. 
            - Future Considerations:
                - Need More space. Will need to store a good chunk of media need to figure out how to store it and access it from plex. 
                - started with a 500GB drive on the plex server this is for a test mostly. I want to probably scap and rebuild once I have a better plan on 
                deploying this with more space. 
        - Challenges:
            - removing plex from master branch.
                1. Not open source.
                2. jellyfin is open source and free. 
*********** END REMOVED THIS FROM LAB *****************

5 Jellyfin server 
    - Reasoning: Self hosted service that I can and did set up in lieu of using plex. I decided to do this instead because the paid features of plex,
    while not wrong, were not what I wanted to deal with. As a result I'd like to go the Jellyfin route and have a few more options with something
    firmly in opensource. 
    - Planning: Current status is in testing. I was able to get this installed manually but I would like to try again with my final product from puppet. 
    I don't think this would be too difficult to do. Just need to read the install document a little more carefully and script a with some more first hand
    knowledge.
    - Challenges: 
        -I need to figure out how to backup/burn my dvd collection to a digital format. There seem to be a few options for this but I'm not sure which way to 
        go with it. 
        - script the install for a better process my first attempt at this was flawed as I had never tried to install it manually before. there is also custom
        instructions for ubuntu with this. I should be able to outline this better and maybe make a few more attempts at this. 
        - extra storage. Will need to figure out a way to make more storeage and add more over time. current server does not have a lot of drive availablilty.
        - Between both of these challenges we should have a bit of work cutout for me. 
    - Results:
        - Jellyfin module works up to installation of jellyfin, and ensures that it is running but my current server already has jellyfin installed so I have not 
        run that part of the script yet. I think i do want to try that before i start putting media on it just to be sure I can get Jellyfin installed programmatically. 
        - Install of Jellyfin has been wildly successful all tests are going as I would expect them to. I am importing a number of DVDs onto the server with the intention of 
        importing a fairly large library by the time i am done. 

PHASE 2:

I've been able to implement a few things Now I'd like to start working on observability and logging and redundancy.

1. Set up a second pihole instance to work as DNS. (done)
2. Set up PuppetDB on a new VM. 
3. Set up a logging visualization application
       Need to evaluate what the best is for my purposes
           -Graphna
           -Elastic
           -Prometheus
4. Start working towards high availability. need 2 more proxmox instances. 
5. BBU. Need small one upstairs for internet. Larger one for downstairs. 
6. Need to start researching a reverse proxy and what I will need to set up in the cloud to get jellyfin set up for use.
7. Consider a better router. I'm a bit concerned this router won't do well if i start opening ports. Its older and I'm a bit worried about security on a more open router. 
    -pfSense
    -opnSense
    -something else?
