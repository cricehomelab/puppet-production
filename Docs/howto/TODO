DONE:

In Progress:
1. Set up a weekly reboot for instances.
    A. Do different pihole instances on different dates.
        a. I have my pihole instances set to update and reboot with a puppet managed cronjob that runs a basic shell script.
    B. Do Jellyfin after 3AM on a weekday.
        a. Once I am able to confirm this works on pihole will implement this on the other devices.
2. I am working on spinning up a server for lab logging.



TODO: 
2. Need to figure out how to update pihole if there is an upgrade available
    A. Ideally Schedule it during a time that is convenient and won't overlap with both devices updating at the same time.
4. Alerting.
5. Need one more host can be SFF to do HA and have consensus.
