There are a lot of logging options and no single solution seems perfect.
I am settling on the idea of running an ELK stack to be my log aggregator
we use it at work which will be a benefit, and it seems to be somewhat 
analgous to Splunk. Splunk was removed from consideration because cost.

I had considered using Grafana, but I think I would have a higher barrier
to entry considering i know less about it than the other two.

I think the only other possible contender would be Graylog, but I have yet 
to investigate that path. ELK seems more used in the industry. 

This should be what is needed for installing on a server host.
