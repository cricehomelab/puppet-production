Welcome to my lab documentation. 

This lab build is to strengthen a few things.
1. I am working towards building automated solutions in a "devops" style way. 
    a. Based on this consideration. I am taking steps with every new change to build my infrastructure as programatically as possible. 
    b. My first main "tool" to accomplish this is Puppet. 
        i. Puppet was selected as this is being used in my workplace, and I want to learn about this tool so I can be a part of that team. 
2. I would like to have some of the cool bells and whistles/conveniance things for my day to day life. 
    a. For example, I've used pihole before, but I've not really spent a lot of time with it. I think now is a good opportunity to learn more about it.
